# Naos Open Source Project
Naos is an Open Source project offered freely under the MIT license, owned and operated by Naos, LLC. It was created for and is dedicated to providing the high quality infrastructure to manage builds, deployments, cloud provisioning.  This allows small developer shops to focus on their business without having to worry about getting or keeping their stuff running.

## Name
Naos is named from the Greek architectural component of temple design (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cella">Cella</a> in Latin).  It seemed appropriate given how structurally important the infrastructure is on a project while generally remaining unseen.

## Currently Offering
* Continuous integration strategy
* Automation to create the minimal cloud infrastructure in AWS
* Automation to create new instances on cloud infrastructure
* Automation to configure software on new cloud instances
* SDK's to access and manage remote machines
* Database migration strategy
